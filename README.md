This folder contains R scripts (and data) to generate figures used in Visscher, Gyngell, Yengo, Savulescu (2024).

The list of files is below
- Figure_1_Top_10_loci_edited.R
- Figure_2_Effect_of_GxE_Partial_rg.R
- Figure_3_Effect_on_Health_Inequatility_Gini_Index_revised_21Fen2024.R
- Supplementary_Figure_1_Off-Target_Effects_on_Fitness.R
- Supplementary_Figure_2_Misspecified_Causal_Variants.R
- Supplementary_Figure_3_Pleiotropic_Effects_on_Fitness.R
- Supplementary_Figure_4_Effect_on_Health_Inequatility_Gini_Index.R

Figure_1_Top_10_loci_edited.R also generates two files named "Example_of_10_loci_to_edit_for_5_diseases.txt" and "Example_of_10_loci_to_edit_for_5_qt_traits.txt", which form the basis of Supplementary Table 1.

The list of summary statistics files is given in list_of_sumstats.txt. The GWAS summary statistics files used to generate the figures are contained in the zipped folder named sumstats.zip.
